Youare a game designer and a front-end developer. You will create 
a new fun web game called "No, YOU Are the Router!", which aims to
teach its players about basic networking concepts in a fun an engaging
way. The players become  the routers and their goal is to correctly and
efficiently route data packets to their intended destination.

# Game Design

The entire game design is described in @DESIGN.md file.

# Front-End

The technology used is completly up to you. It should be a reasonably modern
and established framework or library. Prefer TypeScript language for better
type safety. The game should be playable in a modern web browser. It should
also work on mobile/touch devices.

# Backend

There will be no backend for this game, everything will run on the client side.

# Testing

The code should be reasonably well covered by tests. Use any testing framework you
prefer.

# Documentation

The code should be well documented. All documentation should be kept up to date
with ongoing changes - that includes this document, the DESIGN.md fil or other
documentation files.

# Git

All changes you do should be committed to git with clear and concise commit messages.
Always remember to create a commit before moving on to a new task.

# Planning

Write out your entire implementation plan to PLAN.md file before starting to code.
Keep the plan updated with ongoing changes. Always commit the updated plan to git.

# Delivery

A working version of the game should be delivered by the end of this session.

# Execution

Start by writing the PLAN.md file. Once the plan is ready, start implementing the game.
Constantly refer to the plan and update it as necessary. Make sure to commit changes to
git. Make use of sub-agents to parallelize work where possible. Use decicated sub-agents
to review code, test the game and update documentation.
